Decision Tool
============

A simple tool that uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process structured technique to help you make better decisions.

The concept is:
 - capture the decision you want to make
 - identify the key elements that will influence your decision
 - rank each element against the others
 - visualse the results to understand the most important factors in making your decision
 - make a better decision!
